This is a simple website created using **GitHub Pages** and _GitHub-flavored Markdown_.

## Features

Here are some cool features of this site:
1. **Bold text** for emphasis.
2. *Italic text* for subtle emphasis.
3. Inline code, like `print("Hello, world!")`.
4. Code blocks for longer snippets:
   ```python
   def hello():
       print("Hello, world!")
